<p>This is a page for my weekly technical blogging, mostly on Data Science and Technology. I find that, writing is the  best way to learn and communicate our ideas and skill. So, I have chosen to do it anyways, whether good or bad with one goal in mind: My ability to communicate technical information will not remain the same a year from now with constant practice! If you find errors or I think there is something I can do to improve my skills and grow faster, you are most welcome. If you find a reason to laugh at my naivety, please do so honorably but remember, next year will come back here to learn new skills from here. Enjoy the rest!</p>

<a id="who-am-i" class="anchor" href="#who-am-i" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who am I?</h3>
<p>I am a fresh graduate from a renowned university in Africa with a degree in Computer Engineering. I have decided to do a 'brute force learning' this year so that I can get as much skills and experience as I need to succeed at work and grad school. I love technology and have never been satisfied of discovering new things and unlearning old things. I hope to get a job after a few months of practice and thereafter begin my freelance journey so that I can have some time to build my company.</p>

<a id="appreciation" class="anchor" href="#appreciation" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Appreciation</h3>
<p>I can say 'thank you' enough to all my professors and the institutions I have had my internships experience from. I want to thank <a href="https://www.10academy.org/">10 Academy</a> for the good intro to Data Science. I am now ready to explore on my own, the data science space which I have been eyeing for years without knowing where to start. Thank you to all my friends and family who are supporting me in my learning journey. One day, I will be an expert and you all will be proud that you did invest in me.</p>
